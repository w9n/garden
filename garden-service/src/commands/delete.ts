    This will trigger providers to clear up any deployments in a Garden environment and reset it.
    When you then run \`garden init\`, the environment will be reconfigured.

    This can be useful if you find the environment to be in an inconsistent state, or need/want to free up
    resources.

    Deletes (i.e. un-deploys) the specified services. Note that this command does not take into account any
    services depending on the deleted service, and might therefore leave the project in an unstable state.
    Running \`garden deploy\` will re-deploy any missing services.

    Examples:

        garden delete service my-service # deletes my-service
  `

  async action({ garden, log, args }: CommandParams<DeleteServiceArgs>): Promise<CommandResult> {
    const graph = await garden.getConfigGraph()
