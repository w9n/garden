    This command needs to be run before first deploying a Garden project, and occasionally after updating Garden,
    plugins or project configuration.

    Examples:

        garden init
        garden init --force   # runs the init flows even if status checks report that the environment is ready
  `

  options = initOpts

  async action({ garden, log, opts }: CommandParams<{}, Opts>): Promise<CommandResult<{}>> {
    const name = garden.environmentName
    logHeader({ log, emoji: "gear", command: `Initializing ${name} environment` })

    const actions = await garden.getActionHandler()
    await actions.prepareEnvironment({ log, force: opts.force, allowUserInput: true })

    log.info("")
    logHeader({ log, emoji: "heavy_check_mark", command: `Done!` })

    return { result: {} }
  }
}
